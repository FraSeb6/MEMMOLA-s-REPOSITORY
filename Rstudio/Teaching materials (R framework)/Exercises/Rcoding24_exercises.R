# Ex 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Define a function f which, given a numeric vector as input, returns a
# list containing the mean, variance, minimum, and maximum of that vector.
# Assign appropriate names to the elements of the list and test it with suitable
# input.

# Ex 2 --------------------------------------------------------------------

#  The Collatz conjecture states that, given any natural number n, applying
# the following algorithm:
# a) if n is even, divide it by 2;
# b) if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1;
# then the sequence of elements always ends by reaching the number 1.

# Implement a function that, given a natural number n of length 1 as input,
# returns the next number according to the defined Collatz conjecture algorithm.
# For example, my_collatz(4) should return 2, my_collatz(5) should return 16,
# and so on.

# Ex 3 --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Implement a for loop that prints the lyrics of the famous song "99
# bottles of beer on the wall": http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/


# Ex 4 --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Implement the famous "fizzbuzz" algorithm. This algorithm loops
# through an input numeric vector (i.e., x = 1:100) applying the following
# conditions:

# - if the input at position i of x is divisible by 3, print the string "fizz";
# - if the input at position i of x is divisible by 5, print the string "buzz";
# - if the input at position i of x is divisible by 3 and 5, print the string "fizzbuzz";
# - otherwise, print the value of x[i].


# Ex 5 --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Develop a function (e.g., my_collatz_sequence) that, given a
# natural number n as input, returns as output a vector containing the complete
# sequence of values returned by the Collatz algorithm until reaching 1. For
# example, my_collatz_sequence(5) should return the vector composed of elements
# c(5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
